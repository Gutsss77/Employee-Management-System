#Employee Management System

This project is a simple Employee Management System with several functionalities as discussed below.

The project is written in Python with database connectivity. Currently, this project is under development. If you find anything incorrect or you want to add something, you can contact me. This project includes the following features:

1. Create New Employees: Add new employee records to the system.
2. Delete an Employee: Remove an employee from the system.
3. Employee Login: Employees can log in with their employee ID and password.
4. View All Employees: Display a list of all employees.
5. Attendance Functionality: Employees can record their attendance when they check in and check out. All data is stored in the database.

The database used is MySQL, and the code for the database is provided in the "EMS.sql" file. You might face challenges with the framework of the project as it changes with resolution based on the tests. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this. You can either use this project as-is or take ideas from it to create your own.
